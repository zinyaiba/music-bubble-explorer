# Requirements Document

## Introduction

GitHub Pagesへのデプロイメント時にビルドが失敗している問題を解決する必要があります。この機能は、プロジェクトが正常にGitHub Pagesにデプロイされ、ユーザーがWebアプリケーションにアクセスできるようにすることを目的としています。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the GitHub Pages deployment to succeed, so that users can access the web application online.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the GitHub Actions workflow SHALL complete successfully without build errors
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN all TypeScript compilation SHALL complete without errors
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN all dependencies SHALL be resolved correctly
4. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the application SHALL be accessible via the GitHub Pages URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix build errors, so that the deployment process is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build errors occur THEN the error messages SHALL be clearly identifiable in the GitHub Actions logs
2. WHEN TypeScript compilation fails THEN all type errors SHALL be resolved
3. WHEN dependency issues occur THEN missing or incompatible packages SHALL be identified and fixed
4. WHEN environment-specific issues occur THEN the production build configuration SHALL be validated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be optimized for production, so that the deployed application performs well.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN the output SHALL be minified and optimized
2. WHEN building for production THEN source maps SHALL be configured appropriately for the deployment environment
3. WHEN building for production THEN asset paths SHALL be correctly configured for GitHub Pages
4. WHEN building for production THEN all environment variables SHALL be properly handled

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to prevent future deployment failures, so that the development workflow remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making code changes THEN pre-deployment checks SHALL validate the build locally
2. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN compatibility SHALL be verified before deployment
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the impact on deployment SHALL be tested
4. IF build errors are detected THEN clear documentation SHALL guide the resolution process
